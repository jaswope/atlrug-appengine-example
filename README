This is an example Sinatra app on Google App Engine.

There are a couple of concepts illustrated, including a sharded counter using the direct datastore API, a Datamapper backed user based object, and simple usage of the Memcache and User APIs.

To run locally:
1. gem install google-appengine
2. cd to the code directory
2. dev_appserver.rb .

It will bundle up the required gems and then start the development app server.
